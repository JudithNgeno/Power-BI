# POWER-BI
## OVERVIEW
This repository documents a Power BI dashboard that analyses UK traffic camera activity between 2021 and 2023 using open data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) "Traffic camera activity" dataset. The project explores how movement patterns for pedestrians, cyclists, cars, buses, vans, and trucks evolved across key UK regions (London, Greater Manchester, North East, Nothern Ireland, Reading, and Southend) regions in the period following the COVID-19 pandemic.

## PROJECT PURPOSE
* Provide an interactive view of weekday-adjusted busyness indices derived from traffic camera images, helping users understand how transport activity changed over time across the key UK regions and modes of transport.
* Demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills, from sourcing official government data to modelling, visualising and sharing insights via a Power BI report suitable for portfolio and stakeholder use.
## KEY METRICS AND VISUALS
* Weekday adjusted activit indices by transport mode with trend lines across 2021-2023 to highlight recovery and seasonal patterns.
* Regional comparison visuals that show relative busyness across London, Greater Manchester and other traffic-camera areas, enabling quick benchmarking of movement intensity over time.
## TECHNICAL STACK
* Power BI desktop for data modelling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboard design, following common documentation practices for analytical reports hosted on GIT platforms.
* GitHub for version control and project transparency, including README, PBIX file, exported report artefacts, and notes on the data transformations and assumptions to support future maintenance.
